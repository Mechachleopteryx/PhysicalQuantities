PhysicalQuantities is a python module that allows calculations to be aware of physical units. Built-in unit conversion ensures that calculations will result in the correct unit.

The module also contains an extension for IPython. This allows simplified usage, simply typing in physical quantities as number and unit.

Documentation is contained in IPython notebooks:

This module is based on the IPython extension by Georg Brandl: https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/ipython-physics.
It was converted into a standalone Python module and extended heavily to be as flexible as possible.
