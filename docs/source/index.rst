PhysicalQuantities Documentation
================================

*PhysicalQuantities* is a Python module that allows calculations to be aware of physical units.
Built-in unit conversion ensures that calculations will result in the correct aggregate unit.

This package was developed to be used in engineering applications, providing easy handling of numbers together with units.

The module also contains an extension for IPython. This allows greatly simplified use by typing in physical quantities
directly as number and unit.

This module was originally based on the IPython extension by Georg Brandl:
https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/ipython-physics.
It was converted into a standalone Python module and extended significantly.
